# 📡 Claude Plugins Radar

### The live, hand-curated, machine-readable directory of Claude Code plugins, skills & agents.

Every entry is manually verified. Every star count and last-commit date is **refreshed daily** by

## Why this list is different

| | |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Live, not stale** | Every star count and last-commit date is refreshed **every day** by a GitHub Action. Most "awesome" lists rot within weeks — this one cannot. |
| 🤖 **Agent-readable** | The whole catalog ships as [`awesome.json`](awesome.json). Claude Code and other agents can query it directly instead of scraping markdown. |
| ✍️ **Human-curated** | Every entry is manually checked for quality and relevance before it lands. No auto-scraped junk, no dead links. If it's here, it's real. |

## For agents

Claude Code can read this catalog like a database:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iliasaberkane6-lab/claude-plugins-radar/main/awesome.json
```

Example prompt inside Claude Code:

> Read `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iliasaberkane6-lab/claude-plugins-radar/main/awesome.json`
> and recommend a memory plugin for Claude Code with more than 10k stars. Explain in two sentences why.

The JSON includes `stars`, `last_push`, `license`, `language`, `tags`, `install` hints and `verified: true`
for every entry — updated daily, schema versioned (`awesome-guard/v1`).

## Quickstart

Install a plugin from the official marketplace (auto-registered):

```bash
/plugin install code-review@claude-plugins-official
```

Install a community plugin (add the marketplace first):

```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

> **Install column conventions:** `plugin:` → add that marketplace first, then install by name.
> `npm:` / `clone:` / bare repo → install via the repo's README. `ccpi` → the
> [ccpi](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills) package manager.

## The catalog

Stats are live. Entries sorted by stars within each category. ⚠️ Star counts are a popularity signal,
not a quality rating — read the description before installing.

## Contribute

This list lives from PRs. Three ways to help:

1. **Add a tool** — open a PR following [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/add-tool.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/add-tool.md). A bot validates the entry and refreshes its stats automatically.
2. **Report a dead entry** — open an issue and we'll verify within days.
3. **Improve the engine** — [`awesome-guard`](src/awesome_guard) is a small, dependency-light Python package. PRs welcome.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow.

## The engine

This repository is a dogfood of its own tooling. [`awesome-guard`](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-guard/)
is a pip-installable engine that:

- reads a YAML registry ([`data/entries.yml`](data/entries.yml)),
- fetches live metadata from the GitHub API (stars, license, last push, archive status),
- regenerates the README tables **and** `awesome.json` between marker blocks,
- runs daily on GitHub Actions, and can check any PR that touches the registry.

Run it locally:

```bash
pip install awesome-guard
awesome-guard check                # validate the registry schema
awesome-guard refresh              # fetch live data and regenerate README + awesome.json
```

Use it to keep *your own* awesome list fresh forever.

## Support

If this list saves you an afternoon, a star is plenty. If it saves you a week,
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/iliasaberkane6-lab) is open.

Also building automations for small businesses — spreadsheets, forms, CRMs, workflows —
[this list is one of the things they feed on](https://github.com/iliasaberkane6-lab). Questions are welcome.
